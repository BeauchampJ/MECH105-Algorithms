# Simpson
Uses Simpson 1/3 method to integrate numerically

---

## Description

This algorithm uses the Simpsons 1/3 method to integrate numerically across user defined points. It also uses the trapezoidal rule to integrate end points if there are any left over.

---

## Inputs
-   x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
-   y = the vector of function values with respect to x

---

## Outputs
-   I = the numerical integral calculated via the Simpsons 1/3 method
