# Linear Regression
Finds various statisical data on inputs

---

## Description

While this is a pretty simple algorithm, it allows for the easy import of data and export of
statistics on said data. Its main purpose is to allow for easy analysis of data.

---

## Inputs
-   x: x-coords (array)
-   y: y-coords (array)
-   plot: either 'y' or 'n' for if you want a data plot!

---

## Outputs
-   m: slope of points
-   y0: y-intercept
-   Sr: Square residuals
-   St: total sum of the squares of the residuals
-   Sy: Standard Deviation
-   rSquared: Coefficient of determination

---
##TODO
- [ ] Make presentation cleaner for input and output
- [ ] Add support for graphing data distribution
