# LU Factor
Decomposes matricies to use in Gauss Elimination

---

## Description

This algorithm takes a matrix and decomposes it so it can be used in Gauss Elimination 
(or anything else LUP decompositions could be used for). It is very similar to the
function lu() found in matlab.

## Inputs
-	A = coefficient matrix

---

## Outputs
-	L = lower triangular matrix
-	U = upper triangular matrix
- P = the permutation matrix
